That's why Damn the Man.  The short story is after dealing with a computer error on my Home Depot payment,  (Citi Bank) which they owned up to and admitted there were some glitches, my payment posted late by less than 24 hours. They so conveniently raised my rate to the default of 29.99%. When I inquired and tried to get my rate reset, they said they have no control or ability to do that.  I've never had such a bad experience with any other company or my other Citi accounts.  I only need 2666.00 to pay off the Depot account, it's already been closed, I'm done with them. The balance will be used to consolidate 1 other card that is at 17%, about another $1750.00.  The remaining be paid back to lending club early, at this point I have no need for it, my remaining credit accounts are all at reasonable rates. FYI, the credit score listed is incorrect, I have CreditSecure with American Express and my combined Fico score as December 1st was 703, down from 730 over the last year  because my balances on a couple cards increased for business use and has not been paid down yet.

I had a 760+ credit score - AA - and DTI of 17% until recently, when an old cell phone account dinged my credit and an Exxon account was closed, dropping me to high 600's.   I am a professional financial consultant in my late-30s (I know how money works) and have been employed with the same firm for the last 12 years and our business remains strong.  My firm offers medical & retirement benefits and incentive comp.   Purpose - Loan Request  This loan will be used to refinish our basement.  We are expecting a baby in the fall and my mother in law is coming to live with us.  This will also add value to our home if we ever decide to sell.  Financial Profile  I actively manage multiple secured and unsecured credit lines, all at low fixed rates, with a flawless 0/0/0 repayment record (except for a cell phone account that never worked and I never used and they tried to charge me), and no delinquencies in over 20 years as a borrower. I have a 4:1 assets to liabilities ratio. Most assets are locked-up in conservative tax-advantaged investments, which could be liquidated if necessary.  Income  My base monthly salary is $9,300 plus incentive comp (still working to achieve Cornell’ўО—ОИs alumni average of $150K). Monthly take home is ~ $6,000 after taxes, retirement, insurance, medical, etc.  Monthly Expenses:  Charitable: $400 Mortgage & taxes (5/1 ARM, 4.75% fixed until 2010): $1,691 HELOC (6.5% variable): $200 Food & supplies: $980 Credit card loan payments: $690 (5 cards, from 4.99% to 6.99%, all fixed)  Prosper Loan: $380 (7.0%) Daycare (part time): $250 Car expenses (gas, maintenance): $125 Utilities (gas, electric, phone, water, cable, internet, garbage): $310 Other living expenses (clothes, home improvements, etc.): $125 Student Loan: $118 (3.75% fixed!!!) Insurance (homeowners, life, disability, and auto): $210 Out of pocket medical (co-pays): $40  Total monthly expenses: approx $5,500  Monthly Cash Remaining: approx $500  Conclusion  There is $500+ monthly income remaining to service this loan AND this excludes my wife’ўО—ОИs part-time income and my incentive comp. We both have strong and supportive families. We are stable, careful, conservative, responsible Christians, and live within our means.

My firm is very entrepreneurial and part of its culture is that partners are not paid a salary.  In essence, partners in my firm are paid on a commission basis based on the amount work they do and the amount of business they bring in.  Because partners do not get paid until our clients pay their bills, a new partner must wait at least two months before seeing his/her first check.  Per industry standard practices, the first month of work will not be billed until the beginning of the next month and clients have 30 days (i.e., the beginning of the following month) to pay their bills.  Thus, work done in November is not billed until the beginning of December and is not paid until the beginning of January.  As a result, my next paycheck will not be until next January.  My wife and I are seeking to adopt from a foreign country, which is a long and expensive process.  (It usually takes a few years and costs $20,000 or more per adoptive child.)  As result, we have not been able to save as we would like and we are facing a few more expenses in the next few months.  Although we have already spent most of what we need to complete the adoption, there will be a some expenses (such as international plane tickets and hotel expenses to bring our child home) to pay when the time comes.  My current income is about $132,000 per year.  Because of marketing and other advantages that law partners have over non-partners (i.e., clients are more comfortable doing business with and paying higher rates for partners), I expect my annual income to increase to at least $165,000 per year once I make partner.  I need a loan now, however, to secure the income I will need over the next few months and to give me some time to build my savings and even out the inevitable up-and-down cycles that occur when you depend on commission-based income.  (I would rather get a loan than borrow from my credit cards because credit cards are just too darned expensive.)  One note on the prospects for the legal market:  I have developed legal expertise in different areas that normally exhibit different market trends.  I do a lot of work in complex commercial and employment litigation in federal courts, and I have extensive experience in bankruptcy litigation.  Both litigation and bankruptcy are countercylical (i.e., the work goes up as the economy goes down).  I also advise numerous tax exempt organizations, such as charities, trade associations, and political organizations.  This work tends to grow with the economy and tracks normal business cycles.  Finally, my firm has several competitive advantages, including our location in Washington, D.C.  Federal government services are recession-proof and the businesses in this area (and that come from around the country to lobby or do business here) continue to grow even in the middle of a recession.  That and our ability to deliver high-quality service for a more affordable price makes our firm very attractive even during down times in the economy.  All of these factors mean that our work (and my part of it) should continue to be steady regardless of the economic conditions affecting the country as a whole.  That in a nutshell is my request.  I am looking forward to working with you to make it fruitful both for me and for your investors.",small_business,Partnership Bridge Loan,220xx,VA,15.16,0.0,5/1/87,0.0,33.0,,8.0,0.0,134025,67.9,16.0,f,,1,0

Forgive a long explanation, but I want to give a complete picture to those who consider loans individually.   The past:  I bought my home with a very low-down-payment loan. It's a two-family with good rental income ($1150) in a good location Љ—– walking distance to midtown-direct train to NY.  The loan terms were not favorable looking out a few years, but I expected to be able to refinance my way out before it got bad. I was working as an IT manager and my credit record was steadily improving. Unfortunately, my company's parent company sold us, and I was laid off in the process.   I took a chance and tried to go into private consulting with a partner. Without going into detail, the partnership didn't work - we hardly made money. We broke up, and I was left with his share of six months' expenses, which I had covered.  I also had to deal with the eviction of a bad tenant and the associated financial pain.  Meanwhile, my $300k 1st mortgage rate climbed to 8%, nearly as high as my equity loan ($33k at 9%). I focused on keeping the mortgage payments current, which meant I made some hard (bad?) decisions to get by, including running up credit card debt, delaying payments, and becoming late on my property taxes (which were not escrowed.)  Of course, I also went back to work in the corporate world as an IT Manager.   Now, the present.  I have been 1.5 years working as an IT Manager in Manhattan Љ—– I'm in a stable position with a good firm and salary. I got current and then paid down tens of thousands in debt, starting with the highest rate, intending to improve my credit score while establishing a current salary history so I could refinance.  I just recently entered an arrangement with my 1st mortgage holder, who adjusted the rate to 5.5% fixed for 5 years (variable after) and covered the back taxes. They also paid my taxes forward 12 months, resulting in a $29k escrow deficit.  Then I set about getting an equity loan for $62k to cover the existing $33k loan and the $29k escrow deficit. It is not a good time for equity loans!  Banks have raised equity requirements, and have raised FICO requirements for high LTV loans. Though my score has risen to the 700 range, they want 740 for very high LTV. At the same time, my appraisal has come back lower than expected. I'm not worried about the current value Љ—– I plan to stay here for many years. But it does mean that it's simply impossible to refinance the equity loan now.  This leaves me with three alternatives.  1. Payment program with my 1st mortgage holder where the $29k deficit is paid back over 12 monthly payments. I can do this, but it would be a financial stretch, and I would expect to end the 12 months with \more credit card debt.  2. Refinance the entire home. In the current market, this means high fees and many points just to get a rate of 7%. While this lowers my monthly payments, the terms are so bad that I'd rather deal with the first option.  3. Get a personal loan to help spread the $29k out over more than 12 months, bringing me here.  This $24k loan will be used to pay off the bulk of the $29k escrow deficit - the deficit to be spread out over the next 12 months as an addition to my normal escrow payments.  I expect to be able to pay off my remaining credit card while paying off the escrow deficit. After that, my plan is to:  1. Pay down my Lending Club loan aggressively.  2. Max out my FSA and 401k contributions.  3. Become a lender with Lending Club, bringing me full cycle from borrower to lender.

On the day this loan request was created (5/24) and as my screen name suggests, my FICO Score with TransUnion was 715.  My timely payments in excess of the minimum due each month have not been enough to keep my interest rates at a reasonable level.  While I have been consistently on time with my payments to Citibank, my interest rate has risen to 29.990%.  The majority of my monthly payments (approximately 80%) are now absorbed by high finance charges rather than paying off my actual balance.<br/><br/>I am a successful district manager for Limited Brands' Bath & Body Works division.  More than 1600 stores in the United States and we are expanding into Canada and have a few overseas locations.  I love what I do, have a college degree in my field with no tuition debt, and am so thankful to be gainfully employed in this still difficult environment.    I have been with the company for nearly ten years and have been promoted several times over the past 5 years.  Getting promoted is not just about successful results, it's also about mobility.  I have moved for my job 6 times since 2002, which has been great because all moves have meant more money and greater responsibility.  Even though I received relocation assistance for 3 of the 6 moves, it always involves more money than you get.  The other 3 moves I did voluntarily to be closer to my territory, but with no financial assistance.  The additional out of pocket needs have slowly crept up on me in the form of high credit card debt. <br/><br/>On July 1, 2010 I am moving yet again.  This is an exciting time, albeit an expensive move as my new district is Boston, Massachusetts proper.  This recent promotion brings with it a raise in salary and a company vehicle.  I plan to use this additional income to aggressively pay off my debt and will continue to work to improve my financial situation.  I want nothing more than to pay off this credit card debt and say goodbye to exorbitantly high interest rates. <br/><br/>I think it is genius to have a forum where I can put some money into someone's pocket in return for a loan that will help me get rid of the plastic debt!  <br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration and rest assured I am a worthwhile and sound investment.<br/> Borrower added on 05/28/10 > Additional notes:<br/>I have never defaulted on a loan or financial obligation.  I want to add an additional note to alleviate any potential concerns investors may have about my ability to repay the loan here on Lending Club.<br/><br/>In the unlikely event that I found myself unemployed and without a steady stream of income, I would borrow against my 401k retirement account to pay back my loan here on Lending Club.  As of today (5-28) I have $90,000 between my 401k/savings retirement account.  <br/><br/>Thanks again for considering me as your next investment.<br/>",debt_consolidation,Goodbye High Interest Credit Cards!!!,015xx,MA,7.78,2.0,11/1/89,0.0,15.0,,10.0,0.0,20270,48.7,15.0,f,,1,0

As you can see I am in a bind--a good one-land has skyrocketed in Brazil and now that the world cup in 2014 and the olympics in 2016 the land will easily double again in the next 5 years--I have it up for sale for  1,600,000 reais which is approx. 900,000 U.S.--The buyer of this property will make a fortune whether they landbank or develop it.Also the dollar keeps going lower against the Brazillian Real and my forecast is that it drops another 30 percent giving the buyer an additional discount in currency exchange.Also,a large Norwegian resort just a short 8 minute walk from me is 80 % sold and the small condos start at 200,000 each--huge profits in building and developing.

The balance slowly increased and I wasn't paying attention until it grew to what it is now.  Despite my income, I cannot make the lump sum payment they want.  I could easily pay it off on an installment basis, but they will not transfer the balance to an installment basis, and I cannot pay it off in one month.

These debts are listed below.<br/>Credit Card 1: $13,500.00<br/>Credit Card 2: $11,300.00<br/>Credit Card 3: $3,000.00<br/>Credit Card 4: $7,000.00 (joint account)<br/><br/>I plan to payoff Credit Card 1 with this loan (it's the highest interest rate out of all my cards).  The rest of my credit card debts were accumulated through the purchase of goods to be sold on ebay.  I plan to payoff a major part of this debt, if not all of it, within the next 6 months as I start liquidating my inventory.  <br/><br/>As for my savings of 16-20%, this is accumulated by me maxing out my 401k contributions at work.  Currently, the law lets me put a max amount of 16.5% and my employer matches 3%.  Depending on my other income during the month (bonus at work, ebay income), I either try to pay down my credit card debt or save what I am able to in an interest earning MMA.

I ended up with $5,000 in tax debt. I had some savings to pay a large part  of this debt, but unfortunately my husband had to have an unexpected surgery in April, depleting our savings and leaving us with almost $2,000.00 in medical bills. I have made payment agreements with both the IRS and our medical provider but the monthly payments are putting very tight constraints on our monthly cash flow. I am looking to refinance this debt for a short term (36 months at much lower monthly payments) in order to create some space in our monthly cash flow and and allowing us to stay current on our 2010 quarterly estimated tax payments as well as build up savings for future unexpected expenses. This loan would not be additional debt, we are looking to convert some high monthly payments into more manageable monthly payments.<br/><br/><br/>My approximate monthly budget :<br/><br/>Income: $8,600.00 +/- (net of business expenses including health/dental insurance and tax withholding)<br/><br/>Mortgage $2,298.00<br/>Groceries $800.00<br/>Insurance (auto/life) $320.00<br/>Utilities: $650.00 (including internet &amp; cell phone)<br/>Auto/ Fuel $220.00<br/>Childcare: $400<br/>Credit Card Payments: $572.00<br/>Clothing/Personal Items/Personal Care $275.00<br/>Restaurants/Entertainment $125.00<br/>Education: $1800.00<br/>Medical $100.00<br/>Savings $200.00<br/>Other Non-Discretionary $250.00<br/><br/>IRS Tax Debt $500.00/mo<br/>Medical Debt (surgery) $300.00/mo<br/> <br/>These last two payments would be converted into a single $195.00 payment with this loan.<br/><br/>If I am able to reduce my combined IRS and Medical Debt to a much lower payment, that will enable me to run a positive cash flow once again.<br/><br/>I am aware of 2 late payments recorded on my credit report. These are a result of me not updating the accounts on 2 of my automatic payments in a timely manner when one my banks went in to receivership,(and was eventually taken over by another bank.) These accounts are now current. One was on a car payment that has since been paid off. The other was on a rarely used business credit card. I set up most of my payments on an automatic system. I will make sure all account information is up-to-date and accurate on all future automatic payments.<br/><br/><br/>I have had my private practice in speech therapy for over 5 years and have had over 5% growth in net income each year, with about 7% in 2009. Prior to my own practice I worked in the schools for over 5 years. Currently, speech therapists, both locally and nationwide are in high demand. The need is increasing while the number and size of graduate programs is limited. In other words, I am very employable, even without my own private practice.<br/>",debt_consolidation,DebtCon,980xx,WA,9.84,1.0,2/1/87,0.0,11.0,,9.0,0.0,35061,94.2,30.0,f,,1,0

My responsibilities continue to grow as I bring in new accounts and expand our offerings. My fiance secured a job in management at a sporting goods store with a national retail company in February, and is eager to make a name for himself here. We are both hardworkers and come from similar backgrounds that stress that. <br/><br/>I bought my condo 3 1/2 years ago - and the housing market as taken a hit. We plan to live here for at least two to three more years to be able to be in a better position with the mortgage. Due to the market drop, a home equity loan is not an option.<br/><br/>We feel we are a good borrower because we have recognized the mistakes we made, and are not happy that we put ourselves in this position. We have been trying for the past few months to get a handle on our debt, but feel we can best do this with a personal loan that can help us better manage our payments, and eventually put us in a position to start saving. Not that we were not before, but are now moreso very careful with our money.<br/><br/>This loan will be used to help us pay off a good number of our credit cards, as well as pay the remaining balance due on our wedding. If we knew now what we knew last summer, maybe we would have approached our wedding differently. But hindsight is 20-20, so now we are just trying to get our finances on the right track. <br/><br/>We know that the monthly payment we take on, if our loan is fully funded, will represent 12% of our monthly income -- and this would help put us in a much better position that we stand right now.<br/> Borrower added on 07/29/10 > We appreciate the investments to date.

I do not ever give up no matter the challenges I face. I will succeed. I will continue to live and I will be healthly both physically and with my resources.<br/><br/>My monthly budget? I have about 5 credit cards and two bank loans and one large loan to the hospital. I have the obvious mortgage, auto loan and insurance, household mthly (electric, gas, water, etc). I make a good income and would simply like to be less strapped at the end of paying all my bills and feel like its ok to go to a movie every so often AND get popcorn. Main goal is to consolidate and lower interest rates. Willing to be loans in full just would like to lower the overall interest rates.<br/><br/>How stable is my job? Totally. I am very well respected in my profession and in my company. They saught me out after hearing about my cancer and have supported me as if I were family thorughout the entire process.

But please answer these two questions first please:<br/><br/><br/>1. Do you hold the title to your home on *your own name*<br/><br/><br/>2. How much equity do you have on your house? (please provide the home valuation and total balance of the mortgage/heloc loans)<br/><br/>Member_595101, Thank you for your question and possible financing.  To answer your questions, my home loan is in my husband and my name and is currently $127,299 with $747,00 of the $1,585 going to the principle.  We have been paying on the loan for 15 years give or take a year, and refinanced mainly to lower the years of the loan.  The property was last valued at $575,000 several years ago but that was before the crash.  We can still get at least $300,000-$400,000 concervatively.  I have set aside $900.00 in my bank account provided which is sperate from the family budget in order to pay the monthly payments.  Sorry for the delay in answering your question.  Have a nice day.<br/> Borrower added on 06/03/10 > In the notes section, lending club suggests to offer information regarding on how I will pay back this loan, stable employment, what makes me a good borrower, and monthly budget.<br/><br/>Stable Employment:  I started working at 15 ’дО_ and have only been unemployed once in my life.  I was laid off due to a buyout of my employer, a major financial institution.  At that time it was good news since a severance package afforded me to stay home with my new baby, as well a return to college for a Microsoft Certification Program. I received my MCSE certification and began working for an IT Company where I worked for 9 ’дО_ years.  During the 9 ’дО_ years I moved up the chain and eventually transferred to an account that supported the City.  I was promoted to Network/Server Manager but transferred to my current position when there was an opening.  So realistically, I have been at this current location for over 11 years.  Five years doesn’ўО—ОИt sound very creditable.<br/> <br/>Good Borrower:  For years I had a credit rating of over 820-840s, and want it back.  I allowed myself to be unselfish and naive to loan funds that were never repaid.  I just want this debt paid off and plan to look into helping others through this type of funding.  What a great opportunity.<br/><br/>Monthly Budget:  I have set aside $450.00 bi-monthly which will cover this payment.  <br/><br/>How will I use this loan:  It will be used to consolidate my credit cards and I will be able to pay a lower interest rate, which can be paid off in 3 years.<br/><br/>Thank you!!<br/>",debt_consolidation,Consolidate SZ8J4F,917xx,CA,11.72,3.0,8/1/86,0.0,3.0,,15.0,0.0,32169,60.9,24.0,f,,1,0

This home was previously rented for $450, which is what I plan on asking for it.  My insurance, taxes, and management costs will run about $125, which leaves $325 to cover the cost of my loan at about $287 per month.    In the event that the unit is vacant I can easily cover the payment from my other rental income (net $900/month) or from my salary (net $4,700/month).  My only personal monthly expenses are car insurance at $89/month as we run the household entirely off my wife's income.  I have no other debt aside from the mortgages on my other rental properties.",small_business,Capital Replacement,452xx,OH,0.43,0.0,4/1/94,1.0,,,13.0,0.0,1074,3.9,25.0,f,,1,0

Here is some information that may be helpful to you in making your decision.<br/>I will be using this loan to consolidate three credit cards.<br/>I have never missed or made a late payment on these credit cards or on any other debt.<br/>I discovered Lending Club and found that the rates available here are less than what I am paying on my credit cards.<br/>As I indicated above I have never missed a payment, and the monthly payment for this loan is roughly half what I am paying now.  <br/>I will be repaying this loan well in advance of the 5 year term.<br/>My payment history on all debts is flawless.  However, I am told that my credit score has suffered as a result of the following:<br/>&bull;My debt to income ratio is too high.  A couple things you may want to know about this.  <br/>     oMy monthly income is $9200 and I have been with my employer for over 10 years.  My wife&rsquo;s monthly income is $3900.  Combined monthly income is $13,100.  As you can see making this payment is well within our means.<br/>     oThis loan will of course be used to pay off all the credit card debt on my credit report.<br/>     oThere are two homes on my credit report.  One of them is a vacation home that I rent out.<br/>     oWe have a family member that lives with us who also contributes towards paying bills.<br/><br/>&bull;My credit card balances are high in comparison to their credit limits<br/>     oAs you may be aware with the recent bank crisis many banks have started lowering credit limits on existing accounts.  Since my limits have been lowered my balance is now closer to the card limit.<br/>     oBy paying off my credit cards I expect to see my credit score go back up since my total balance will be a smaller percentage of my total available credit.  My point being that I am very interested in improving my credit score so defaulting on this loan is the farthest thing from my mind.<br/><br/>Please feel free to share any thoughts or questions you may have.<br/>Thank you,<br/> Borrower added on 12/19/10 > My original description read &quot;This loan will of course be used to pay off all the credit card debt on my credit report.&quot;  This should have read &quot;This loan will of course all be used to pay off credit card debt on my credit report.&quot;  Sorry for any confusion.<br/><br/>In reviewing the questions Lending Club investors often ask of loan requesters I found the most often is postion within their company.  I am a Government Accounts Manager.  In short, this is a sales position with a heavy emphasis on managing the relationship with a variety of high profile government customers.<br/>Kindest regards,<br/> Borrower added on 12/20/10 > I saw a few investors had asked other loan requesters about their 401k.  So I thought it might be relevant to add that my wife and I have a combined $120,000 in our 401ks.  I hope this will add to your confidence in funding our loan.<br/>Thank you.<br/> Borrower added on 12/21/10 > I want to say thank you to all of you that have invested with me so far.  I feel much better knowing that the interest I will be paying on this loan is going directly to other good people as opposed to the banks.<br/>",debt_consolidation,CC consolidation.

The financing will help me to quickly get this home up to a standard where we can enjoy it.  The term sought is 5 years or more.  As you know, traditional real estate financing is difficult.  In this case the acquisition debt plus this debt will at the end result total less then 80% of the home's market value.  Problem is, the banks won't currently lend based on anticipated value but only on 80% of the current value which is depressed due to the old kitchen and no deck.   My credit is outstanding.

As an active duty military member, I have been deployed for 8 of the last 10 years, and found it difficult to achieve the financial security I was hoping.  While I do have college savings and a home, I would rather not tap into those secure investments to pay off my credit cards.  Instead, this loan will allow me to pay off my credit card debt within 5 years, and at the same time allow my savings and home to continue to appreciate.  I have never defaulted on a loan, including a home loan, and I have no intention of ever defaulting on my financial obligations. That is exactly why I are hoping to pay off our revolving debt with this loan. The easy answer would be to go to a credit counseling company, but it is my obligation to pay off my debt, which is what I will do with this structured loan.  Just as I serve my country with honor, I also honor my commitments, including my financial commitments.  Thank you for your favorable consideration.<br/> Borrower added on 06/27/11 > I would like to add, that my long, positive credit history supports the fact that I honor my financial committments, having never once defaulted on a debt.  This includes my home, which I proudly pay each month.  Although offered a huge mortgage during the mortgage gold rush, I only assumed a loan that was within reason given my income.  As a result, I have never been late in my five years of owning the home.  In addition, I proudly own a home in full.  So while I have collateral, I would rather not tap into these secure assets, and instead remain disciplined to pay off my credit card debt in 5 years while my assets continue to appreciate.<br/>Thank you again for the response and the favorable consideration.<br/>",debt_consolidation,consolidation,981xx,WA,16.46,1.0,10/1/84,2.0,9.0,,19.0,0.0,56301,71.5,47.0,f,,1,0

I CANCELLED THE ORIGINAL LOAN REQUEST AND RAISED MY REQUESTED AMOUNT.  I WAS AMAZED AT THE REPSONSES (THANK YOU) SO I AM GOING TO REQUEST WHAT I REALLY NEED TO HIT THE GROUND RUNNING ON THIS DEAL. I went into business with family. I was 50% co-owner of a truckstop. We built it in 2007. For the first year and a half, my partners stood back and let me run it. I made over $300K with it in 2008. In early 2009, they decided to participate and it went down hill fast. To make a long story short, it went under in Nov. 2009. The landlord, our fuel supplier (Amaroil.com), evicted our company for past due fuel invoice debt. The landlord wishes to re-lease the site to me (because I made us money when I was alone) and understandably wants me to obtain my own working capital to re-enter the business. I cannot qualify for any conventional lending because I have no collateral. Everything I have is tied up in my business. I have one past 30 day hit on my credit record my entire life. All three of my Fico's are over 700. I am married with a 2 year old, I like to hunt and fish in my off time. I have been married for 5 years, and my wife works side by side with me in the business.<br/><br/>Your money will be paid back. Your money will go to good use (working capital). I pay and treat my employees very well, and alot of people are depending on me to get this thing back going. If interested, I can give you the google earth location to see the site for yourself.<br/><br/>Thanks for any consideration.<br/><br/>Craig<br/>Borrower added on 12/29/09 > I wanted to add: Anyone who is a small business operator now days guards their credit with their life.

Thank you for taking the time to consider my loan!  <br/>I would like to use my loan for paying off my credit card debt.   I&rsquo;ve worked for the past 7 years designing software.  I work at large companies, not startups so there is no danger of being laid off.   While Oracle is very stable, I haven&rsquo;t had a raise or bonus in 3 years.  The only additional income I&rsquo;ve had is a thousand dollars from filing patents.<br/>I first got into debt in college, as most people do.  Unlike others at my Ivy League university, I paid for college myself.  I paid for everything, starting with my application fee while still in high school.  Whereas other parents paid their part in the financial aid package, my mother loaned me the money for theirs @ 7%.  (Of course she was the first to be paid back&hellip; who wants to have an angry mother!)  I also worked full time for the first two years.  In hindsight, this was not the best decision, but I wanted a quality education and had to pay for it somehow.  Fast forward 4 years.  I graduated with around $50K in loans and $30K in credit card debt.<br/>Over the years my credit card balances have had their ups and downs.  The most recent upswing started 4 years ago when I bought my house.  It is 110 years old, so as you can imagine, there is a lot to do!  I&rsquo;ve done all the small things I can without hiring professionals, but I know that is the next step.  Before I start any remodeling I know I need to pay off my credit card debt and save up.  <br/>If you check, my credit score is good.  Partially because I&rsquo;m great at paying on time, partially because I&rsquo;m one out of five people on a $1.1M home loan.  The building is a 4 plex.  My portion of the loan is $400K.  I bought my house just before the market bottomed out.  Not the best time, but I wasn&rsquo;t thinking of my house as an investment to flip.  <br/>All of this combined was not a prescription for financial health.  Add to it the financial meltdown(s) over the last few years and it just compounded the issues.  During the boom years, credit card companies gave me more and more credit.  Then after the meltdown they all started to re-assess their credit strategies.  They looked at me and decided I was carrying too much debt and they needed to lower my credit limits &ndash; to just above my balance.  This meant that my credit to debt ratio went from great to high risk almost overnight.  And where one credit card company goes, others are sure to follow &ndash; and they did.  Eventually, this affected my credit score and brought it from Excellent to Good.  That was the end of Round 1.  In Round 2 they looked at my credit score and then my APRs.  Several cards were raised astronomically, which was the final blow.<br/>",debt_consolidation,Axing the APR,941xx,CA,16.8,0.0,12/1/90,0.0,,,9.0,0.0,49692,89.3,22.0,f,,1,0

My financial situation:  I have a full time job as a finacial consultant with a well funded company.    My living expenses are well below my total income and my investment in this business venture will only go to strengthen my financial position.  I have never been late on one payment in 10 years since I first established my credit. The financial risk of this investment is limited to my investment of $25,000 and the rest of the financing is in place from the other partners so that the certainty that the project will reach completion is already assured. The  return on investment is projected to be 9% in the first year after my debt serrvice but jumps to 12%-15%  in the second and third years. Since this is a long term investment the negative return for the first few years is justified as it will be positive once the loan is repaid.

My wife and I recently purchased a new house in the Palm Springs area and began renting out our first home in the Brentwood area of Los Angeles.    The new home is a condo unit in a country club and was built in the 1950's in a contemporary style.  Even though it is structurally sound, since it is an older place, we want to undertake a few small projects.  First, we need to purchase and install a new air conditioner before the summer, as the old unit is too small to cool the house adequately in the summer (apparently the prior owners only lived in the home during the winter months).    Second, there is an exterior golf cart garage that the prior owners enclosed to use as a storage area.  However, the construction was not done properly, and the drywall they used has become moldy and needs to be replaced.  Also, the foundation of the garage is below grade and needs to be repoured so that it does not accumulate water.  Finally, there are a few minor household projects we would like to undertake, such as installing some lighting and improving the airflow for our air conditioner/heater.    I would like to obtain a loan through Lending Club as opposed to disturbing our existing HELOC (which we took out at the same time we obtained our initial mortgage) because the HELOC contains a significant prepayment penalty.  We have explored other options such as financing the air conditioner through the installer, but the interest rates are too high for our liking.  I had heard about peer-to-peer lending sites in Consumer Reports' Money magazine, and we are looking to give it a try!

NC law indicates an equitable distribution should apply.  The goal is to invest up to $20,000 in hiring a competent divorce attorney to achieve the $100,000 in assets.    The assets from the divorce will be used to settle all debts.  Remaining proceeds would start a retirement fund, begin investments and be used to fund additional education. Presently I have an MBA and JD (I did pro-bono, some regulatory and in-house counsel work for startups previously, as a member of the Bar, but I do not practice law now).  I use that education in my work in enterprise procurements for a large government entity.",other,Equitable Distribution of Assets,208xx,MD,5.84,1.0,11/1/91,1.0,21.0,,5.0,0.0,13363,99.0,21.0,f,,1,1

I also recently sold my expensive and newer financed cars and instead now have two older used cars with much smaller loans/payments and only 3 year terms (both with about 2 years left, one partially through LendingClub).<br><br>  My accounts, approximate balances, and APRs are:<br> Direct Merchants: $4200 (28.99%)<br> Chase: $3400 (31.99%), $3300 (17.24%), $1200 (29.24%)<br> Citi: $2100 (29.99%)<br> Sears: $2300 (28.99%)<br> Merrick: $2000 (22.99%)<br> Capital One: $1900 (16.15%), $1800 (12.4%), $1000 (19.8%), $450 (14.4%)<br> Best Buy: $700 (29.99%)<br> HSBC: 300 (29.99%)<br><br>  I am aware that some of these cards have lower APRs than the loan I am requesting, however they have annual fees that are expensive, and having just one payment per month will be less stressful for me and worth the few extra dollars to me. I plan on immediately closing all of these accounts except one for emergencies. I am aware that it will damage my FICO score, but I don't want or need any of these accounts or the fees.<br><br>  I have been working for my employer for about 4 years now and it is a full time and very stable position, and I enjoy it very much. <br><br>  I have always made all my payments on time except one in 2006 which was accidentally not updated when I moved and did not give the bank the right address. I missed one payment but have always been on time since then.<br><br>  If you have any questions, please let me know. Borrower added on 06/21/11 > I would like to add that my FICO score is quite low, but only because I recently changed from a big bank to a small credit union.  I also refinanced my two cars through them, and I also looked into refinancing my house with them.  Finally, they extended a line of credit for what they call &quot;Instant deposit&quot; which allows me to mail checks to them but credit my account in the meanwhile.  <br/><br/>As a result, my credit report FICO score took a 40 point hit from around 700 to 660, resulting in my disappointing &quot;F1&quot; score here on LendingClub.  My other LendingClub account before this was rated MUCH more favorably (it was a B or C score I think?) and nothing has changed much in terms of my overall credit standing.<br/>",credit_card,Credit card consolidation loan,201xx,VA,17.78,0.0,10/1/96,2.0,,99.0,15.0,1.0,17419,57.9,37.0,f,,1,0

We have prepared for over 2 years for this event and are now less than 3 weeks from opening.   Our plan is simple: Become a customer friendly, phenomenal tasting, one-stop treat shop!   We will also carry one of the finest Italian Coffees, which is a highly anticipated drink for the 200+ employees in the Administration building in our same parking lot.  Our shop is in a tremendous location next to the corner of a heavily traveled intersection and less than 1 mile from 2 major highways intersecting.   Our Competition?  The usual grocery stores that use box-mix and not 'made from scratch' ingredients!  That have store-bought ice cream, which is not home-made.    Our success was never in doubt and our sales expectations exceed $300k annually.  We are need of a little more capital in order to purchase some new equipment, like a $15k walk-in cooler/freezer combo that will benefit us more in the long run over the standard 3 door freezer and 3 door fridge. It is 5 times their size and saves $150/month in electricity since the condensers are roof-mounted and will not heat the store up, which would require more a/c. We also need 2 new mixers, valued at $3500 each and a $1300 commercial stove.   We plan to open satellite locations in high foot-traffic areas that will have a low overhead (rent/payroll)and just receive our morning deliveries for sales.  This will increase our overall output in our main location and boost sales/profits.   So join us and one day you will remember being a lender to a company that had a global vision and made it happen!

This loan is for a property/business purchase in New Zealand. My wife and I are interested in purchasing a working vineyard on the North Island, outside of Wellington in the Wairarapa Valley. We already have an offer for funding from a major NZ bank, who have done their due dilligence and found us to be of excellent quality.  However, NZ banks lend for agribusiness ventures such as this only on the value of the land and not on the value of the grapes, trellises, etc. My wife and I have about 25% of the total value of the land saved up, and the bank is offering another 50%, so we're looking for this loan to put us over the hump in terms of the downpayment necessary.   This is exactly the time to enter the NZ wine industry, because it's hit its trough in terms of oversupply (in Sauv Blanc) and has undergone a major consolidation. Moreover, the vineyard is planted with 5.68 hectares of pinot noir and pinot gris, two grape varieties that have withstood downward price pressure throughout the global recession.  Additionally, this particular vineyard is a buy now because: <br/>1. the vineyard is already working, has been for 10 years <br/>2. the vineyard has management contracts with an established winery, who will look after the grapes and return a profit on the purchase price of the grapes (estimated at about $20,000US per year, or nearly the cost of this loan!) <br/>3. interest rates are of course at rock bottom <br/>4. the winery this is attached to is known for highly rated wines in a niche market (for example, Gourmet Traveller rates their pinot noir at 97 points out of 100) and is actually looking to expand (hence why they're selling off the vineyards, to raise capital for the winery itself). They have seen sales increase during the recession, and are well-situated to take advantage of global recovery. Basically, they will continue to buy these grapes well into the future.  Anyway, my wife and I have more than enough income flow to cover payments for this vineyard - I work for a major international organization and make approximately $182,000 per annum - but we need slightly more stock for the downpayment (we were surprised that the NZ banks would only lend 50% of land value, which ended up just about being 40% of the total price). Also, the NZ dollar has been plummeting versus the US dollar lately (so long as the Dow is down), so every dollar invested in this goes a lot farther for us.

I was able to pay the minimum each month but then the interest on the cards started to edge up one after the other, I found myself swimming against the tide.

I reside and work in San Diego, CA.  I have been with my current employer for over 8 years.  My title is Business Development Manager and we are a software development company.   EXPLANATION OF CREDIT HISTORY:  I had my share of struggles in my younger years (18-21) as I did not understand the importance of fiscal responsibility and maintaining good credit.  I acquired much credit card debt and did not consistently pay my bills on time.  Since then, I have taken great pride in diligently righting my financial wrongs and rebuilding my credit profile.  As you will see in my 5-7 year credit history, I have been successful in consistently maintaining successful credit.  I regularly monitor my credit and consider myself to be very financially aware and responsible.  My current FICO score (updated March 1, 2008) is 667.  My goal is to use this loan to pay off credit card debt and bring my score above 700.  With this loan, I am asking for a chance to completely pay off all credit card and other debt and consolidate into 1 recurring monthly payment.  I promise to all lenders bidding my loan that making my payments on time will be my top priority each month.    Also, as you will see in my financial details below, I have the necessary resources to do this successfully.  This is due in part to a very strong and stable income (mid 6-figure W2 in 2007).  Please also see attached PDF of my 2007 W-2 showing income of over $148,000.   WHAT I WILL DO WITH THE MONEY LOANED TO ME:  I will completely pay off all credit card and recurring monthly debt and consolidate into 1 monthly payment.  The resulting effect will be a strong increase in my credit score as this will vastly improve my percentage of credit available aspect of my credit profile.  Additionally, this will enable me to avoid the costly finance charges I am acquiring each month with these credit cards and to focus only on my monthly payments to Lending Club.  The long-term goal of this loan is to eliminate these other debts, continue my strong payment history, and position myself to purchase my 1st home in the next 2-3 years.   HERE ARE MY MONTHLY FINANCIAL DETAILS:  Net income after payroll deductions from all sources: $6,500.00  EXPENSES Rent: $1,150 Phone: $60 Gas: $20 Electricity & Water: $20 Car Loan and Operating Expenses: $700 Food / Necessities: $200 Insurance: $70 Cable/Internet: $75 Misc expenses, etc. $200 Other: $200 ----------------------- Total Monthly Expenses : $2,695  I will have $3,805 left to make the payments on my loan.   CLOSING REMARKS TO LENDERS:  Thank you for taking the time to review my loan application.  With the assistance of this loan, I will be able to further establish a steady ground for my financial stability and future growth.

My goal is to be debt-free as quickly as possible.  My financial situation: I am a good candidate for this loan because while I am able to currently pay my credit cards, I am not making a big enough dent in the actual balances to really make a difference. Using Lending Club, I will be able to pay these down more quickly.  Now that I am in a great job making good money my intention is to pay quite a bit more than the minimum every month. It is unlikely it will take me the full balance of time to pay off this loan.   I am currently working in local government where I make a decent income for someone my age and I would like to take advantage of this opportunity to pay off the debt I incurred while trying to reach this professional goal. I have no accounts delinquent and have never fell into the red with any of my creditors.  I know I would make an excellent investment for LendingClub Investors.  Below are the balances of my current cards. I would like to note that all of this debt was on one card a two years ago, but I transferred it to many no-interest/low-interest cards to try and put a bigger dent in the balance. Now many of the promotional APR offers have expired on those cards and the rates have gone way up.     1. Bank of America American Express - $8,272 @ 10%    2. Chase Visa - $2,550 @ 19%    3.

I was downsizing my homes and had just closed escrow on a new smaller home. I had my older larger home on the market. Then the Calif market crashed. I lost my clients (banks) and had to close up shop. I was unemployed for several months. In the meantime I did everything I could to sell my home,but I could not, eventually it was foreclosed upon and I lost it. I lived off these cards until I found a job with a large company which I have been with for 4 years now. Because these cards were maxed it, the companies keep increasing my interest rates until it just got out of control. I am just sick of paying on them only to see most of my payment going to interest.I have tried to communicate with them, but I think because I'm never late, they won't budge. I would also like you to note, according to Lending Club, I am only 10 points away from an excellent credit rating.<br/>",debt_consolidation,stupid decisions,923xx,CA,6.85,0.0,8/1/92,0.0,26.0,,12.0,0.0,14302,56.5,33.0,f,,1,0

It would seem odd that with 23k a month coming in that I need a cushion.  The reality is that after taxes that is 16k (+/-) and my alimony/child support payment is currently 10k so that leaves me 6k in cash each month.  My thought is that (and I won't break down my bills in granular format) I could use an extra 500 to 1k a month and this is a good way to get that backstop.  Importantly, there is a time horizon on these large payments as my lovely ex-wife gets her last payment in 2014.  So, I see the light at the end of the tunnel.<br/><br/>Other question has been is there real estate exposure on my books or something else creating a real liability.  The answer is no.

We're a happily married couple (17 years) with children, and we're seeking a loan to eliminate our credit card debt. For years, we've consistently paid more than minimum payments and paid on time.   Recently an incident that resulted from the Chase taking over of WaMu has made us wary of credit cards in general.  We were told that we had agreed to accepting statements via email (something we do not recall agreeing to). However, their first email statement was sent to an old email address. When we discovered the error and realized our payment was late, we immediately paid. However, Chase DOUBLED our interest rate as a result of this one late payment!    I'm sure you can understand our frustration with Chase since we were always a good, long-time customer of WaMu with no history of delinquencies.   HSBC is another company that has raised interest rates recently with no apparent reason. We were simply notified they were raising rates, and there was nothing we could do about it.   We are asking for a loan to pay off all our credit card debt and get out from under these ridiculous interest rates. We've always paid more than minimum payments, but with rates this high, it's virtually impossible to pay them off.   We run a successful marketing business with lots of high-paying jobs on the books. And since we specialize in marketing, we are experts in creating new business for ourselves on-demand (recently we ran a promotion for $300 and generated $8000 in sales in 10 days).   Many of these credit card purchases were from marketing and investments in building our business, at the time of these rate increases we were working hard to pay off these debts. We have no doubt that we will easily be able to pay off this loan and give you a good, safe return on your investment.

My pension plan does not allow more than one loan at a time. I need approximately $18,000 to pay off my current loan. I would like to borrow $18,000 from Lending Club to pay off my current pension plan loan. I will then re-apply for another loan with my pension plan to take advantage of my higher pension plan balance. I will then pay Lending Club back as soon as my old Pension Plan loan is paid off and the new loan is issued.   My employer and I renegotiated my contract for five years adding about $1,000 a month to my income. I now make $128,000 per year. In January 2010 I will be making and addtional $2,500 per year. I  have a clause in my contract that if I am fired, I will be paid three months pay as well as my sick time and vacation time. I have been working here for nearly three years. Due to a signed contract I will be another five years.  It is my intention to repay the loan I borrow from Lending Club within 30 days. This pension plan at my current workplace has a balance of nearly $60,000 and the plan allows for up to 50% loan. In addition I have another $10,000 in my 457(b) (Deferred Comp Plan) which I will tap into to assist me in paying as much of my credit card debt as I can.   I will secure the loan I get from you against the balance in my 401(a) Pension Plan until it is paid in full (again, I believe it should be less than one month).  My overall intention is to pay off about $15,000 in credit card debt. At that point I will only have $4,000 left which I will pay for in six months. I will then be paying off the pension plan loan.  (Chase $5,550.00, Discover $5,250.00 and Chase #2 $4,750.00)  Due to the short term nature of the loan, I am willing to pay up to a 1.5% fee plus an interest rate of up to 10%. My calculations are that Lending Club will make about $420 for a loan of $18,000 for thirty days.  This is a long story but I am trying to pay off all my debt (including my mortgage) in the next 84 months. This will greatly assist me in doing that.

We received 0% interest for the first 6 months, and have been paying $216 a month since June. The promotional rate of 0% is ending soon (in November); the rate will then jump up to 21.90%, retroactive to when we first purchased the windows. Originally, we had expected to take out a home equity loan to pay for the windows before the promotional rate ended. With the drop in our house's market value, the credit crunch, etc..., that is no longer a viable option. Plan B was to transfer the balance from the window credit card to an existing credit card that has more than enough available credit. Terms on this card are 8.874% APR, as long as we pay at least 5% of the balance each month (which we do). Unfortunately, that credit card company is not offering any balance transfer offers at the moment (surprise, surprise!), so Plan C is to use a convenience check from that credit card, which carries the cash advance terms of 16.453% APR, with a 3% fee (no cap). I decided to look into Lending Club as a potentially better Plan C.  I am a good candidate for this loan because I have excellent credit and have never missed or been late on a payment in almost 20 years of borrowing. I have a stable, secure, decent paying job. I have been with my current employer for only 1 year and 7 months, but have been in the same industry for 12 years, with only one previous employer (in this industry).
