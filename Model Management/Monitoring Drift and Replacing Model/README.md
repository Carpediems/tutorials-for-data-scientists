# Model monitoring: data drift detection

Scope: The scope of this notebook is to provide instructions on how to detect data drift and replace the model in the deployment.

Background: The model performance depends on the data used for predictions. Data drift can lead to unreliable predictions which is why it should be monitored to the model replacement.

Requirements: Python 3.7; DataRobot API version 2.20
