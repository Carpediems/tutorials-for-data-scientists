# Predicting CO2 levels for Mauna Loa

An example of how to predict CO2 levels for one of Hawaii's Active Volcanoes, Mauna Loa. The historical data that indicate monthly CO2 levels follow an agressive upward trend. That is why normal random validation will not work and we need to do Out of Time validation (OTV) in oder to correctly evaluate that our model works as intended.

### Getting Started

Follow the steps as outlined within the notebook file. There is also a training dataset you can review: `co2_mm_mlo.csv`

### Problem Type
Regression - OTV
