## DataRobot API Training

The DataRobot API Training is targeted at data scientists and motivated individuals with at least basic coding skills who want to take automation with DataRobot to the next level. Here you will be able to learn how to use the DataRobot API through a series of exercises that will challenge you, and teach you how to solve some of the most common problems that people run into.

Start by reading carefully the "API Training - Introductory Notebook". This will help you learn the basics and provide a concrete overview for the API.Afterwards, go within the /exercises folder and start downloading and solving the exercises.

The list of exercises is as follows:

- Exercise 1  Python/R API Training - Feature Selection Curves 
- Exercise 2. Python/R API Training - Advanced Feature Manipulation 
- Exercise 3. Python/R API Training - Model Documentation 
- Exercise 4. Python/R API Training - Beyond AutoPilot 
- Exercise 5. Python/R API Training - Model Factory 
- Exercise 6. Python/R API Training - Continuous Model Training
- Exercise 7. Python/R API Training - Using a Database

Keep in mind that the current repository contains answers to many questions posed within the exercise notebooks. Searching is part of this learning path!

Last but not least, for the R API Training, we have also included a folder called `Markdown (backup)`. RMD documents might be harder to read so there is the alternative of reading through the md files.
